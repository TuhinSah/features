California has been going to Hell since Europeans moved in and began murdering native tribes.

We need to go 5 more year's to even touch the worst drought in recorded history. The difference now is 50+ million people as opposed to 20 million. We will keep multiplying until we really can't sustain the population, it's just how it works.

A liberal probably started it for a little overtime, that is more like it.

The notion that dead trees are "fuel for fire" is a common misconception. Scientists say climate, not dead trees, drives fire risk. In times of drought, green trees are actually more flammable than dead trees. See this recent article in High Country News for a more in-depth explanation: https://www.hcn.org/issues/48.13/california-plans-...

How is this historical? 
Scientists say that the west coast of North America had a 240 year long drought that started in the year 850. Then 50 years after that drought ended, another 180 year drought occurred. 
 
Now I don't know about you, but 240 years of drought back when man wasn't putting anything in the air pretty much makes the current drought look pretty feeble.

Since wildfires existed before man, the Clayton fire couldn't be arson. Good logic.

Historical for the time the current occupiers have been on this continent , or about 500 years . 
Just curious , how old are the people skewing the discussion to obsessions with Non relevant interpretations of words or phrases ?

what exactly does trump have to do with a natural drought in Cali? Really? Cali is owned lock stock and barrel by the liberal elite. If you're looking for someone to point at, how about Pelosi's billions of barrels of oil production. Moron.

But I thought Rush Limbaugh and Senator Inhofe both said that the drought that's being caused by climate change was a hoax ?

Where is the PROOF that the drought is caused by AGW? There is NO proof.

No one, and I mean no one, can connect the drought with wildfires. Besides that, the drought that liberals love so much is gone.

You either don't live in California or you're ignoring the facts. 
 
There has not been enough precipitation to alter the fact that there are thousands of acres of extremely dry, brittle brush. All it takes is a minor spark to set off one of these monstrous blazes. That could come from a lightning strike or something else. 
 
Why don't you ask one of the state firefighters about how real the drought is? Because clearly, you have no idea what you're talking about.
