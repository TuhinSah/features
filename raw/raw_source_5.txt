Hope China will send more humanitarian aid than anyone else. By the way China humanitarian does not mean military

I passed the volcano 2 days prior and the landscape was spectacular. Now it's a mess. incredibly no deaths. Life can change in a heartbeat.

My son was in Wuxi, Beijing, & Shanghai this past week. The pictures of the massive housing construction that he's shown us as well as the rows of ancient ramshackle housing had me wondering about the effects of a quake or other natural disaster.

Jeez, what inane comments, especially the first two.

I hope Nepal gets tons of aid from around the world and my sympathy goes out to the survivors.

I spent some time in Nepal a long time ago and still remember some of the landmarks this story refers to. I also remember how friendly the people were.

Lovely people. I hope the climbing world will come to their aid as they have benefited so much over the years from the warmth and hospitality of the Nepalese people and the skill of the Sherpas.

Good job by the Globe in choosing to go with this excellent AP story filed by a veteran Nepali reporter, Binaj Gurubacharya.

The New York Times, on the other hand, continues to lead with an awful, rambling piece written by an insufferably clueless American woman who, as is standard procedure for the Times nowadays, is reporting from 1,000 kilometers away and relying mostly on Twitter reports. 

Meanwhile, another Times reporter, this one also in Delhi, has given us an even more oblivious piece: out of the 2,000 dead we are for some inexplicable reason offered up the story of a Google engineer who died while climbing Mt. Everest. 

And the Times, in an effort to underscore its ignorance, insists on calling the city Katmandu [sic].

Anybody who's interested in this story should stick with the AP.

...and now the Globe has replaced the original AP story with the NYT's fly-by-wire tripe. Just dandy.

I'm sure that the lord cares more about the compassion and ethics which people demonstrate by their service to their fellow members of humankind than by how they respect and worship Him, if they do a'tall, that is, than by their particular faith. You're to be commended for your empathy and tolerance for those different than yourself. Peace, brother. Sincerely, WPF

Barry O.H., whom some of us Americans claim as their President, played at being a comedian during the April 25, 2015 White House Correspondents Dinner. Asked if he had a bucket list (things he want to do before he goes to his eternal reward), he said maybe he would say something that rhymes with that popular movie title. He got a few hahas from his obedient audience, many of which was supposed to be journalists, but was in reality gangs of Hollywood stars and their hangers-on. Among the things Barry refers to with his 'bucket list' gag line is Nepal, where some 2,500 people are reportedly dead in a huge 7.8 earthquake around the capitol of that poverty stricken Himalayan nation of some 27 million. Liveshot Kerry, the United States roaming secretary of state, made the usual "gee, ain't we sorry for them poor folks"-type remarks, said a couple of American disaster teams would be dispatched to help out, and then proudly announced the biggest deal of all. A million bucks... a whole million . . . a million dollars . . . in cash to help out the Nepalese. 
A million dollars. . . and there you have the 'bucket list' twinning sentiments of the President of the United States - this guy who pivoted the American diplomatic and military strategies to Asia a few years ago, a guy whose economic policies are a bid dis and dat, but mostly bucket list stuff except where it benefits his cronies and the closest in terms of time projects he can find. What a snaz of a guy . . . note that our President didn't say a word about the Clinton Foundation picking out a few tens of thousands of the hundred dollar bills that have piled up in that charity's coffers . . . he just let Liveshot put out the million dollar amount that pretty much lets the rest of the world know how important he considers Nepal even if that country is the source of the Ghurka soldiers so prized in the British Army.

The AP dispatch missed this important part of the story:

"The Israeli military is sending 260 trained personnel to deal with the aftermath of the earthquake in Nepal, which killed more than 2,300 people and leveled large areas of capital Kathmandu.

The IDF team will focus on search and rescue and creating a full field hospital, which will be operational within 12 hours of landing.

“Because we coming in a relatively short time, we are hoping to find survivors underneath the rubble, so for this stage the main mission is to save lives,” said Col. Yoram Loredo, who is the commander of the Search and Rescue Corps and the head of the IDF delegation to Nepal..." -- Times of Israel

I'm sure the Israelis will mingle well with the contingent being sent by Iran.
